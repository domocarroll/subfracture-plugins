# How to Install Brand World Design

A simple guide to get BWD running in Claude Code.

---

## What You'll Need

- **Claude Code** installed on your computer
- About 2 minutes

---

## Step 1: Open Claude Code

Open your terminal (the black window where you type commands) and type:

```
claude
```

Press Enter. You should see Claude Code start up.

---

## Step 2: Add the Subfracture Plugin Library

Once Claude Code is running, type this exactly:

```
/plugin marketplace add domocarroll/subfracture-plugins
```

Press Enter.

You should see a confirmation message that the marketplace was added.

---

## Step 3: Install Brand World Design

Now type:

```
/plugin install bwd-brand-world-design@subfracture-plugins
```

Press Enter.

You should see a confirmation that the plugin was installed.

## Step 4: Start Using It

You're done! Now you can use these commands anytime in Claude Code:

### Start a Full Brand Journey
```
/brand-init
```
The Weaver (Danni) will welcome you and guide you through the complete brand strategy process.

### Quick Positioning Session
```
/quick-position YourBrandName
```
Get your FOR/ONLY/BECAUSE positioning in about 15 minutes.

### Creative Strategy Session
```
/pits
```
Develop your Problem-Insight-Truth-Solution narrative.

---

## What Happens Next?

When you run `/brand-init`, you'll meet Danni — The Weaver. She'll ask you some questions about your brand and guide you through the Seven Chambers:

1. **Mind** — Discover your purpose and vision
2. **Mirrors** — Build your positioning (FOR/ONLY/BECAUSE)
3. **Resonance** — Define your ideal audience
4. **Poles** — Sharpen your differentiation
5. **Rhythm** — Craft your story
6. **Chains** — Validate your strategy
7. **Union** — Bring it all together

At the end, you'll have a complete Brand World Document.

## Troubleshooting

### "Command not found" when typing `claude`
Claude Code isn't installed yet. Visit https://claude.ai/code to download it.

### "Marketplace not found" error
Make sure you typed the command exactly as shown, including the forward slash at the beginning.

### "Plugin not found" error
Try running Step 2 again to add the marketplace first.

### Something else went wrong?
Just ask Claude: "Help me install the BWD plugin" — it can guide you through it.

---

## Need Help?

Once you're in Claude Code, you can always ask:
- "How do I start a brand journey?"
- "What can the BWD plugin do?"
- "Help me with brand positioning"

Claude will guide you from there.

*Happy brand building!*
